Recipes for gluten free (delicious) foodstuffs made by my wife, Catherine.

## Recipe Format
Each recipe should be human and machine readable.  We therefore have a strict format for each recipe.  The format is in markdow, and should adhere to:

# <RECIPE NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>

## Ingredients

    * <QUANTITY> of <INGREDIENT>
    * <QUANTITY> of <INGREDIENT>
    * <QUANTITY> of <INGREDIENT> (<COMMENTS>)
    * ...

## Directions

    * <DIRECTION 1>
    * <DIRECTION 2>
    * ...

All quantities should be in a decimal form (i.e. choose .5 instead of 1/2).  Additionally, when listing directions, if you reference an ingredient use the EXACT same name.  That way we can parse the directions and have references to all the different ingredients.

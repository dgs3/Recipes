# Roasted Sencha
Roasted Sencah bought at David's Tea

This tea was the roasted version of a regular Sencha that I enjoy from David's.
It's a bit on the pricy side.  From the first brew, it doesn't seem to be worth 
the extra 4 bucks an oz.

<td>The flavor was pretty good, but definitely overbrewed.  It tasted this way almost immediately, so I would say putting less tea in next time (probably 1.5 tea spoons) would be best.  I'm not sure I really tasted the roasted flavor either, but maybe the overbrew masked it.</td>

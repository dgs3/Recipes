<td>Pronounced flavor.  Tastes very milky, but gives off a bit of a dry sensation.  Probably overbrewed, but still good.  I can probably get away with a second brew, since I used a large quantity of tea.  I left a cup of tea in the french press in the fridge for 12 hours, and it was delicious.  Milky, aromatic.  Definitely worth it.</td>

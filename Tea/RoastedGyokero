<td>Smells delicious, just what I imagine roasted green tea smells like.  Interesting taste.  I don't drink many gyokeros, so maybe its just I'm not used to the smell.  Delicious taste, super roasted.  Slightly bitter.  I'll try 2.5 tea spoons next time, for the same amount of time.</td>

<td>Second brew was good as well.  Had the same roasted flavor.  Super concentrated tea flavor, without the bitterness of being overbrewed.</td>

<td>We iced the third brew.  It was ok.  I wouldn't be too optimistic about this iced though</td>

<td>Again, has a roasted flavor.  Probably a bit too brewed.  At boiling temperature, it didn't taste super awesome.  When it cooled for a couple minutes, it tasted significantly better.  We can drop it down to 1.5 tea spoons, and maybe 2.5 to 3 min.</td>
